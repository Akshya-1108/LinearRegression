# ðŸ“Š Linear Regression from Scratch (Single & Multiple Features)

This repository contains two separate projects demonstrating **Linear Regression implemented from scratch in Python**:

- ðŸŸ¦ [Single Feature Linear Regression](./LinearRegression_SingleFeature)
- ðŸŸ¨ [Multiple Feature Linear Regression](https://github.com/Akshya-1108/LinearRegression/tree/main/linearRegressin_multipleFeature)

Both projects include:
- Custom gradient descent implementation
- Data generation or usage
- Visualization of results
- RÂ² score for performance evaluation

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LinearRegression.git
   cd LinearRegression
2. Navigate to the desired folder and run the script:
    cd LinearRegression_SingleFeature
    python LinearRegression_SingleFeature.py
