# 📉 Linear Regression with Multiple Features (from scratch)

This project implements **Multiple Linear Regression** with 10 features, built from scratch using Python and NumPy.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses synthetic data generated with `make_regression` from Scikit-Learn
- Manual feature normalization
- Custom gradient descent
- Visualizations for each feature vs. target
- Loss curve visualization
- R² score evaluation

---

## 🛠️ Run Instructions

```bash
python linearRegression_MultipleFeature.py
```

---

## You’ll see:

  - Scatter plots of each feature vs. target
  - Training loss over iterations
  - Predicted values and final R² score

## 📦 Dependencies
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
