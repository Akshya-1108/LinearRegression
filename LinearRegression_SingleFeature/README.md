# 📈 Linear Regression with a Single Feature (from scratch)

This project demonstrates **Linear Regression** using a single feature, implemented from scratch in Python.

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- Data generation with noise
- Manual feature normalization
- Train-test split
- Gradient descent implementation
- Model evaluation using R² score
- Visualization of data and error reduction

---

## 🛠️ Run Instructions
1. **Run this command in your prompt**
  ```bash
    python LinearRegression_SingleFeature.py

```
---

## You’ll see:

  - Scatter plots before and after normalization
  - Loss curve across training iterations
  - R² score for evaluation
